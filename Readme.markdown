#NAF(Not A Framework) on PHP

**Attention: This framework is not design for big sites, it very lightweight so it's good at small system e.g admin-panel.**

*I am a newbie to design architecture, and this is my first framework.*

I am now working on a project that building an admin-panel like cpanel to manage my school's system, so I start to write this framework.
There still lots of works need to do, this repo has some project files, I'd clean them later.


This framework integrated smarty and redbean, and it's business-oriented, for example, a business as to show something details, 
I call it app, it will have a class to handle get and post, a func definition file to seperate business logic, and some tpl files to present result.

Other part. I'll write this later. :)
